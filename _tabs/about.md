## Bachelor of Computer Science

My passion started in 1996. when I was amazed by the new tech wave that was opening new possibilities in the business, entertainment and telecomunications. Old enough though to remember 'good old times' when we used floppy disks, had no Internet, exchanged the software from hand to hand. 

Many years afterwards, I decided to study computer science and got my bachelors in the Autumn of 2022. (will be updated here on the diploma's arrival). 

Currently pursue backend technologies like Python, C#, database stuff (MySQL and MS SQL), but am opened to other fields as well.

## Bachelor of Economics and MBA

Back in time, have invested in higher education in Economics and earned my <a href="https://sbozich.github.io/assets/about/01Bachelor.pdf" target="_blank">Bachelor degree</a>, which is <a href="https://sbozich.github.io/assets/about/02StatementofcomparabilityforforeignhighereducationqualificationsGermany.pdf" target="_blank">officialy recognized</a> in Germany as well.

Surprisingly, that was not enough for me so I pursued and <a href="https://sbozich.github.io/assets/about/03MBA.pdf" target="_blank">successfully finished</a> MBA studies.

As an addition, I wrote a <a href="https://sbozich.github.io/assets/about/10Scientificarticlessummary.pdf" target="_blank">couple of scientific papers</a> as well.

I almost enrolled the PhD studies but due to the lack of time cancelled it at the last moment. Here is a <a href="https://sbozich.github.io/assets/about/06LetterofRecommendationWilliamParrott.pdf" target="_blank">letter of recommendation</a> to it.

## My career
I was a licenced <a href="https://sbozich.github.io/assets/about/11broker.pdf" target="_blank">stock broker</a>, an <a href="https://sbozich.github.io/assets/about/07BEFfund.pdf" target="_blank">investment consultant</a>, and a personal manager and recruiting specialist in Germany.

My native language is Serbo-Croatian, and I speak good <a href="https://sbozich.github.io/assets/about/08CambridgeC1.pdf" target="_blank">English</a> and <a href="https://sbozich.github.io/assets/about/09GoetheC1.pdf" target="_blank">German</a>.
