## IT enthusiast
I am passionate about backend stuff like C#, Python, database design.

Remember 'good old times' when we used floppy disks, had no Internet, exchanged the software from hand to hand.

Like retro computing scene and music.

## Like social sciences (economics in particular)
Because we live in a resource-limited world, optimization is necessary. 

## Will finish this section, as soon as I complete the rest of the site
