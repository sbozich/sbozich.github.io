Ever been faced with two (or more) massive lists and the daunting task of finding what’s changed?  
Manually comparing spreadsheets or text files is tedious, error-prone, and a huge waste of time.  

That’s why I built **List Comparator & Processor** — a free, browser-based tool that makes list comparison and data cleanup effortless.

> 💡 **Privacy First:** Your data never leaves your computer. Everything runs locally in your browser.

## ⚙️ Powerful Features at Your Fingertips

Our comparator is packed with capabilities that give you total control over your data:

- **Multi-List Comparison**  
  Go beyond just two lists — compare up to **four lists simultaneously** to find common entries or create a unified master list.

- **Intuitive Comparison Modes**  
  For two lists, choose from five clear options such as **“In Both (A ∩ B)”** or **“Only in B (B − A)”**.  
  For three or more lists, use **Intersection (In ALL lists)** or **Union (All distinct items)** for quick, broad insights.

## 🧹 Advanced Data Cleaning

Before comparing, clean your data with a click:

- Trim whitespace  
- Remove empty or duplicate lines  
- Perform **Find & Replace** (supports **Regex** and “Apply to All Lists”)

These options make it easy to standardize or transform entries across multiple lists at once.

---

## 📁 Flexible Data Input

Simply **paste your lists** or **upload files** (`.txt`, `.csv`).  
If you upload a CSV, the tool intelligently lets you **choose the column** to compare — perfect for contact lists or data exports.

---

## 📊 Rich Results Display

For two-list comparisons, you’ll see:

- A **Venn diagram** giving an instant visual summary  
- A **color-coded Diff View** highlighting added and removed lines

## 👥 Who Is It For?

This tool is built for anyone who handles text or data regularly:

- **Marketers:** Clean email lists, find new vs. unsubscribed users, or merge contacts from different campaigns.  
- **Data Analysts:** Reconcile datasets, spot discrepancies, or identify common records across multiple sources.  
- **Developers:** Compare configuration files, logs, or feature lists between versions.
